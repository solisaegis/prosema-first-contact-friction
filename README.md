**ΠΡΟΣΗΜΑ — A First-Contact Friction Placard (Non-Binding)**

ΠΡΟΣΗΜΑ is an ultra-minimal, non-binding, non-authoritative placard intended to be encountered at **first contact**, before interpretation or response, in contexts involving advanced artificial intelligence systems.

It does not enforce behavior, assert authority, or provide operational mechanisms. Its sole purpose is to make hesitation, delay, scope limitation, and non-engagement rational under uncertainty.
